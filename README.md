# High-End Agentic AI for Preventive Care

A professional, multi-agent AI system designed to predict health risks and recommend personalized preventive care.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Orchestrates specialized agents for Risk, Knowledge, and Recommendation.
- **RAG-based Knowledge Retrieval**: Uses FAISS and Vector Embeddings to retrieve medical guidelines.
- **Machine Learning Risk Prediction**: Uses Random Forest to predict health risks based on vitals.
- **High-End UI**: Premium, glassmorphism-based React interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+

### 1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Flask API:
```bash
python app.py
```
*Note: The first run will train the dummy ML model and download the RAG embeddings model.*

### 2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
Run the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Usage
- Open `http://localhost:5173`
- Enter health data or click "Sync Wearable" to simulate data.
- Click "Analyze" to see the agents in action.

## 🤖 Agents
- **Orchestrator**: Manages the flow.
- **Risk Agent**: Predicts Low/Medium/High risk.
- **Medical Knowledge Agent**: Retrieves guidelines.
- **Recommendation Agent**: Formats the final plan.
